Ok, I wanted to create this kind of program, but I have this difficult task. I want to create a very simple drawing of monster, which is circle  and:
- with one eye in the middle (which indicates vision, so how much territory can see and find food etc.)
-size (has to eat more food if it is larger)
- color (more warm color is more eager to duplicate and the number of children is bigger)
- little two lines, which supposed to be legs(if legs are shorter, it is slower)
- little two lines, which supposed to be arms (it can harm other predators. larger is more harmful)
